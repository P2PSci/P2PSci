<strong style="font-size: 1.8em;">P2P Science</strong> is a set of four applications, currently in beta:

- **Peer Servers**
    + *decentralising scientific communications at the server*
    +  originally drawing on the work of p2p developers such as [Michiel de Jong](https://unhosted.org/manifesto.html) and [Dominic Tarr](https://scuttlebutt.nz/), then switching to Solid
- **Personal websites as queryable research data**
    + based on the work of [Ruben Verborgh](https://ruben.verborgh.org/), pre-Solid
- **Cognoscope** web app
    + *re-integrating scientific communications at the client* (RDF-based twitter for science)
- **Alethiometer** mobile web app
    + *thin-slicing scientific communications on mobile* (RDF-based Tinder for Science)

The organisation of the scientific enterprise is seizing up: competition for high-impact publication, problems with h-index and peer review, and rich-get-richer effects in distribution of funds, are combining with replication problems, administrative and PhD overproduction, corporatisation of the academy, and the rise of in-silico science.
